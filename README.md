## Thank you [@serversideup](https://github.com/serversideup)

This project is inspired by the [serversideup/docker-php](https://github.com/serversideup/docker-php) project, I love it. However the owners seem to be quite busy updating their projects, so I created this project.

I thought I could make it more maintainable and stable with the latest middleware.
